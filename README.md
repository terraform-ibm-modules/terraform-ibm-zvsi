## Summary

This repository contains WaziaaS deployable architecture solutions that help provision VPC landing zones and interconnect them. The below solutions are available and can be deployed with terraform.

Two solutions are offered:
1. [Quickstart Variation](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-zvsi/tree/main/solutions/quickstart)
    This pattern deploys the following infrastructure:
    - Workload VPC with Wazi as a service VSI.
    - Uses Floating IP addresses for access through the public internet.
2. [Standard Variation](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-zvsi/tree/main/solutions/standard)
    This pattern deploys the following infrastructure:
    - Separate VPC for edge.
    - Separate VPC for workloads.
    - Virtual Server Instances for subnet.
    - A resource group for cloud services and for each VPC.
    - Cloud Object Storage instances for flow logs and Activity Tracker.
    - Encryption keys in a Key Protect instance.
    - A edge and workload VPC connected by a transit gateway.
    - All necessary networking rules to allow communication.
    - Virtual Private Endpoint (VPE) for Cloud Object Storage in each VPC.
    - A client-to-site VPN gateway in the edge VPC.
    - A jump server Bastion host VSI in the edge VPC without floating IP.
    - A site-to-site VPN in the workload VPC.
    - Wazi as a Service VSI in the workload VPC.
